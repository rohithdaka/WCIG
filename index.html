                <h2>Preface</h2>              
                    <p>The ability to <em>perceive</em>, <em>understand</em> and <em>judge</em> things is a crucial attribute to every engineer. More often than not, engineers are recruited based on this ability than the skills they built up. Unfortunately, there are many people who has this ability but couldn't fulfil their potential due to various barricades. One such barricade is <strong>language</strong>.</p>
            
                     <p>To be specific: the language of <strong>Mathematics</strong>. This is not an attempt at disrespecting this language. Without math, there is no way human civilization can progress. However the scientific and engineering community has given the language (math) much more importance than physical intuition in education at all levels. Human minds learn faster through physical intuition than through mathematical reasoning.</p> 
                
                     <p>This <em>reactive document</em> is an attempt to provide such physical intuition necessary to comprehend various concepts in Wireless Communications. I hope, after playing here, an engineer would be able to use the corresponding math to do the heavy lifting required to get the job done in a much better way.</p>
                
                     <p>Disclaimer: Due to my lack of experience in web development, I inclined towards ease of implementation than accuracy as long as I didn't compromise on the overall intuition. I hope to improve those sections when time permits.</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                     <p>Thanks to many scientists from Bell Labs, we discovered that any information can be translated to a set of binary digits. The reader should be able to play with various subsystems that enable today's wireless communications.</p>
                
                 <h3>Assumptions</h3>
                     <p>To keep it simple, we already have the information bits that need transmission. They could be part of video, audio or text (compressed or otherwise). We don't need to care. Our objective here is to play with all the subsystems that transform these information bits into various forms before they appear as they were at the receiver.</p>
