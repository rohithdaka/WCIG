    <article class="Introduction">
        <p>Welcome to an Interactive guide to understand the amazing concepts that are used to send our data wirelessly. This site is primarily for those who already have a basic knowledge of high school physics and mathematics. Often times, static diagrams in textbooks are inadequate to visualize what is happening. With amazing developments in web technologies, we are able to finally build a solution that is simple to use to learn the concepts. </p>
        <p>As you may have already noticed, the navigation bar at the top shows the categories into which the subject is divided. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Antennas: Devices that convert alternating electrical currents of high frequencies into electromagnetic waves and vice-versa</li>
            <li>Transmission Lines: Structures that are designed to carry those high frequency alternating electrical currents from/to Antennas</li>
            <li>RF Front End: Circuit blocks that links a Modulated electric current signal to the transmitable electrical current signal (Carrier)</li>
            <li>Modulation: The process of converting digital transmittable bits into predetermined standard waveforms</li>
            <li>Coding: The process of removing redundancy in the message bits(Source Coding) and adding error-correction/detection bits (Channel Coding) to generate transmittable digtal bit sequence</li>
        </ul>
